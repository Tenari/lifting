# Basic Bodybuilding

## in one sentence

Make a plan and be consistent in following it, because year in and year out dedication is what makes impressive physiques.

## in one minute

Because consistency is key, be sure to create a log of your workouts as you go.

Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter. Do your research about what is a [reasonable result](http://weightrainer.net/maximum_bodypred.html) for your body.

Nutrition, Recovery, and Training are the three pillars under which all aspects of bodybuilding fall, and each one is vitally important. Neglect one at your peril.

Good nutrition means eating the correct number of calories, from food sources which give you the correct grams of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. About 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is a good rule of thumb. Good nutrition requires planning out your meals and preparing them yourself, as well as restricting restaurant visits. Supplements beyond multivitiamins and creatine and whey protein and caffeine are generally a waste of money.

Good recovery means sleeping 7.5-9 hours per day, and keeping your stress levels low. Setting a regular bedtime and sticking to it is good. Naps are good. Prayer or meditation is good. Stretching, hot baths, music, journalling, or other legitimately relaxing activities are good.

Good training means lifting enough sets of heavy enough weights enough times per week to stimulate the muscles so that they grow. Compound barbell lifts are a good starting place, but may have a limiting fatigue to stimulus ratio as you get more advanced. Adding weight to the bar, or reps to the set, or sets to the session or in some way making the muscle stimulus increase from session to session, and week to week is fundamental to building muscle. Varying exercise selection is important in order to activate the full range of muscle fibers. Deloading is necessary for intermediate and advanceed trainees.

### What bodybuilding is

Bodybuilding is manipulating the muscle and fat portions of your body compisition in order to create and maintain an aesthetic physique. For most men this boils down to keeping your ![Body Fat Percentage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190717145633if_/http://approvemymacros.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BODY-FAT-PERCENT-CHART.jpg "body fat % estimator") (BF%) between 6-15% and raising your [Fat Free Mass Index](#ffmi-calc) (FFMI) to your genetic ceiling (between 24 and 27).

In other words, **build muscle** and **lose fat**.




### Why bodybuilding?

Do I even need to answer this? Obviously you got interested in lifting because you want to look better. Don't bullshit me. More importantly, don't bullshit yourself. If you want to look better, sexier, buffer, jacked, ripped, or whatever, admit it consciously to yourself. Too much time is wasted in the gym by people who keep changing their training goals every week and then wonder why they don't make any impressive progress. If you're trying to get big one week and then trying to just lift strong the next week, and then doing cardio the week after that... Well you'll be way ahead of all the assholes sitting on the couch, but you're definitely not making optimal gains. If you really truly want to workout but not because you want to look better, fine. This isn't for you. But please don't pretend you want "general fitness" when what you really want is for Stacy to notice you and come over to your place after the party.

### Noob gainz

When you first start lifting you will get very quick strength gains, followed by very quick hypertrophic gains. ("Hypertrophy" is the science word for muscles getting bigger). Unfortunately, after you have been (seriously) training for anywhere between 1 month and 6 months, those gains taper off and all of a sudden you have to get smarter with your program or else you'll stall out and start to get frustrated. I certainly did, anyway.

So basically, when you're first starting out, *what* you doin the gym kinda doesn't matter. Just go. But as you progress, it continues to matter more and more, until you're eeking out tiny gainz on super complex mesocycles manipulating many variables. I will supply a full plan for beginners and so on, but you can get through the newbie stage with pretty much anything. Starting Strength is what I did initially and it built me up to a 255lb squat for 5 reps in 6 months. Stronglifts, 5/3/1, whatever. Just do something.

---

Experiment with yourself! Human bodies have a wide range of variation in ability and responsiveness to training. Be your own scientist. If you or someone smart that you respect disagrees with a recommendation here, then by all means, compare the two approaches. But keep notes. The difference between someone serious about something and someone who is just dicking around is note taking and deep thought.


## Principles

Key principles to bodybuilding, in no particular order:

- volume(how much work you do) is a key driver of hypertrophy
- compound barbell lifts are an efficient use of time in the gym, but come with high fatigue costs, which need to be balanced in more advanced trainees
- Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter.
- consistency is king. Make a plan and stick to it.
- Nutrition, Sleep/stress, and Lifting are the 3 main parts of bodybuilding. Dont focus on juse one and neglect the others and then wonder why things arent going well
- progressive overload - workouts must consistently get harder in some metric or your body will have no reason to grow
  - you could do more sets
  - you could do more weight
  - you could do more reps per set
  - you could do more workouts per week
  - you could do less rest between sets
- most supplements are useless wastes of money, and the ones that arent only account for a VERY small percentage of your overall muscle growth (5% or less)

## Step by Step Overview

if you are a raw total beginner

1. get a place to workout (home or gym)
2. schedule time to workout (initially 3 days per week)
3. write out training plan + log
4. Watch youtube videos on technique for the exercises in your plan
5. calculate caloric needs for growth (strict meal planning not necessary initially)
6. make sure you eat enough protein g and enough calories every day
7. take "before" picture and measurements (weight, arm, leg, neck, etc)
8. use peaking calculator to estimate where you could legitimately end up
9. follow the beginning lifting program for at least 3 months

if you have already gotten easy newbie gains

1. strict macro-counting meal plan
2. supplements
3. follow 3 cycles bulking, 1 cycle cutting meso-cycles lifting plan generator, starting at 6-10 sets and working your way up based on your own body feedback
4. repeat step 3 for 3 years

if you are an advanced lifter

1. great go figure your own shit out

## Beginners

### Where to workout

Home is better than gym if you have space and can afford the upfront cost. Some people live in cramped quarters or are bad with money and live paycheck to paycheck. For these people the only real option is gym.

If doing gym, pick whatever gym is closest, cheapest and has a squat rack/bench presses. Smith-machines are NOT squat racks.

If doing home, buy a:
- [squat stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01855EGXI) ($70)
- inclineable bench ($80 - $150)
- olympic barbell + plate set ($225 at academy)
- 2 bumper 45-lb plates ($120)
- 2 Loadable 20" Olympic Dumbbells (~$60)

total cost: $625 max. Cheaper if you can get em used, which is often possible. a $40 gym membership means this is a cheaper route in less than 16 months, not to mention more convenient. Worth it.

### Training logging

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
$ ./lift.rb log 'bench' 150x8 150x8 150x7 -rpe 8
```

And your activity will be recorded, and your bench strength will be updated for future reference giving weight/rep-range combos.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, just use a spreadsheet

### Training planning

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
./lift.rb generate program --beginner
```

And it will schedule your first 3 months of lifting. Then you can just `./lift.rb show week` each week to see what you'll be doing in the gym.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, do the following:

If you fail to get all 6 reps in any (or all) of your sets for a lift, that's fine, just retry the same weight next time.

```
week 1:
workout 1: squat, bench, pull up
workout 2: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 3: squat, bench, pull up

week 2:
workout 1: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 2: squat, bench, pull up
workout 3: deadlift, press, bent row

workout 1.1:
  squat     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  bench     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  pull up   as many as you can in one set
workout 1.2:
  deadlift  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  press     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  bent row  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
workout 1.3:
  squat     2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  bench     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  pull up   same number as last time

workout 2.1:
  deadlift  2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  press     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  bent row  2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
workout 2.2:
  squat     2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  bench     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  pull up   1 more than last time
workout 2.3:
  deadlift  2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  press     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  bent row  2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
```

and from then on just repeat the following program until you fail to add 5 lbs to the lift 3 times in a row.
```
week 1:
workout 1: squat, bench, pull up
workout 2: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 3: squat, bench, pull up

week 2:

  bench     3x6 at +5lbs
  pull up   2 sets, +0 reps and +0 reps

  deadlift  3x6 @ +5lbs
  press     3x6 @ +5lbs
  bent row  2x6 @ +5lbs

  press     3x6 @ +5lbs
  bent row  2x6 @ +5lbs
```
