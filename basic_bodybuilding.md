# Basic Bodybuilding

## in one sentence

Make a plan and be consistent in following it, because year in and year out dedication is what makes impressive physiques.

## in one minute

Because consistency is key, be sure to create a log of your workouts as you go.

Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter. Do your research about what is a [reasonable result](http://weightrainer.net/maximum_bodypred.html) for your body.

Nutrition, Recovery, and Training are the three pillars under which all aspects of bodybuilding fall, and each one is vitally important. Neglect one at your peril.

**Good nutrition** means eating the correct number of calories, from food sources which give you the correct grams of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. About 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is a good rule of thumb. Good nutrition requires planning out your meals and preparing them yourself, as well as restricting restaurant visits. Supplements beyond multivitiamins and creatine and whey protein and caffeine are generally a waste of money.

**Good recovery** means sleeping 7.5-9 hours per day, and keeping your stress levels low. Setting a regular bedtime and sticking to it is good. Naps are good. Prayer or meditation is good. Stretching, foam-rolling, massages, hot baths, music, journalling, or other legitimately relaxing activities are good.

**Good training** means lifting enough sets of heavy enough weights enough times per week to stimulate the muscles so that they grow. Compound barbell lifts are a good starting place, but may have a limiting fatigue to stimulus ratio as you get more advanced. Adding weight to the bar, or reps to the set, or sets to the session or in some way making the muscle stimulus increase from session to session, and week to week is fundamental to building muscle. Varying exercise selection is important in order to activate the full range of muscle fibers. Deloading is often necessary for intermediate and advanceed trainees.

### What bodybuilding is

Bodybuilding is manipulating the muscle and fat portions of your body compisition in order to create and maintain an aesthetic physique. For most men this boils down to keeping your [Body Fat Percentage](#body-fat-estimator) (BF%) between 6-15% and raising your [Fat Free Mass Index](#ffmi-calc) (FFMI) to your genetic ceiling (between 24 and 27).

In other words, **build muscle** and **lose fat**.

Bodybuilding, like many human endeavors, has levels of complexity that increase as you progress. However unlike many endeavors, people are often tempted to focus on the advanced issues first, and ignore the basics. Each of the three pillars of Nutrition, Recovery, and Training are filled with minutia that are highly unlikely to affect a beginner. While it is theoretically possible for an ultra-obessed novice to immediately start putting everything into practice, in reality that is rarely a good idea, since being overwhelmed lowers the odds that you will consistently stick to it. And the most important part of bodybuilding is **adherence**.

Can you stick to your training? Can you be rock solid and never miss a workout, always hit your macros, never stay up too late, etc? So if some advanced technique with minor benefit is going to impact your ability to ADHERE TO THE PLAN, do not bother with it. It will be counterproductive. 

So while this document will try to go into all the details, please do not miss the forest for the trees. Advanced lifters can worry about complicated techniques and nutrient timing. Novices just need to actually lift.

### Why bodybuilding?

Do I even need to answer this? Obviously you got interested in lifting because you want to look better. Don't bullshit me. More importantly, don't bullshit yourself. If you want to look better, sexier, buffer, jacked, ripped, or whatever, admit it consciously to yourself. Too much time is wasted in the gym by people who keep changing their training goals every week and then wonder why they don't make any impressive progress. If you're trying to get big one week and then trying to just lift strong the next week, and then doing cardio the week after that... Well you'll be way ahead of all the assholes sitting on the couch, but you're definitely not making optimal gains. If you really truly want to workout but not because you want to look better, fine. This isn't for you. But please don't pretend you want "general fitness" when what you really want is for Stacy to notice you and come over to your place after the party.

### Beginner

When you first start lifting you will get very quick strength gains, followed by very quick hypertrophic gains. ("Hypertrophy" is the science word for muscles getting bigger). Unfortunately, after you have been (seriously) training for anywhere between 1 month and 6 months, those gains taper off and all of a sudden you have to get smarter with your program or else you'll stall out and start to get frustrated. I certainly did, anyway.

So basically, when you're first starting out, *what* you do in the gym kinda doesn't matter. Just go. But as you progress, it continues to matter more and more, until you're eeking out tiny gainz on super complex mesocycles manipulating many variables. I will supply a full plan for beginners and so on, but you can get through the newbie stage with pretty much anything. Starting Strength is what I did initially and it built me up to a 255lb squat for 5 reps in 6 months with a pretty nice foundation layer of muscle. Stronglifts, 5/3/1, whatever. Just do something.

#### Beginner Nutrition

If you are higher than 20% bf%, you'll want to start off in a [calorie deficit](#energy-balance). In lieu of complicated calorie tracking you can probably achieve this by doing any or all of the following:

- Restrict eating only to mealtimes. No snacks between meals.
- Remove soda from your diet.
- Remove or reduce alcohol intake.
- Count how many times you eat food from a restaurant in a normal week, and limit that number to a few less than normal.
- Restricting meals to only what can fit on one plate. No seconds.
- Skipping breakfast.
- Drinking water when you are hungry for a snack instead of eating the snack.
- Eating more raw vegetables. (High satiety to calorie ratio)

If you are lower than 20% bf%, you'll want to start off in a [calorie surplus](#energy-balance). In lieu of complicated calorie tracking you can probably achieve this by doing any or all of the following:

- Ensure you eat at least 3 meals per day.
- Eat until it feels like you are forcing it at each meal.
- Drink whole milk. (Low satiety to calorie ratio)
- Add in protein shakes.

#### Beginner Recovery

Set a bed time and stick to it at least 6 out of 7 nights per week. Proper sleep is integral to muscle growth. Sleep is when a lot of the muscle damage from training is repaired, and new tissue is built.

#### Beginner Training

There are several steps that should be completed before you lift any weights:

1. [get a place to workout (home or gym)](#where-to-workout)
2. schedule time to workout (initially 3 days per week)
3. write out training [plan](#training-planning) + [log](#training-logging)
4. Watch youtube [videos](#youtube-exercise-technique) on technique for the exercises in your plan
5. take ["before" picture](#before) and measurements (weight, arm, leg, neck, etc)
6. use peaking [calculator](http://weightrainer.net/maximum_bodypred.html) to estimate where you could legitimately end up

##### Where to workout

Home is better than gym if you have space and can afford the upfront cost. Some people live in cramped quarters or are bad with money and live paycheck to paycheck. For these people the only real option is gym.

If doing gym, pick whatever gym is closest, cheapest and has a squat rack/bench presses. Smith-machines are NOT squat racks.

If doing home, buy a:
- [squat stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01855EGXI) ($70)
- inclineable bench ($80 - $150)
- olympic barbell + plate set ($225 at [academy](https://www.academy.com/shop/pdp/cap-barbell-300-lb-olympic-grip-weight-set))
- 2 bumper 45-lb plates ($120)
- 2 Loadable 20" Olympic Dumbbells (~$60)

total cost: $625 max. Cheaper if you can get em used, which is often possible. a $40 gym membership means this is a cheaper route in less than 16 months, not to mention more convenient. Worth it.

##### Training logging

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
$ ./lift.rb log 'bench' 150x8 150x8 150x7 -rir 8
```

And your activity will be recorded, and your bench strength will be updated for future reference giving weight/rep-range combos.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, just use a spreadsheet.

Be sure to log each workout, as well as regular weight and body measurements. Without good logging, it will be very difficult to gauge progress.

##### Training planning

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
./lift.rb schedule program --beginner
```

And it will schedule your first 3 months of lifting. Then you can just `./lift.rb show week` each week to see what you'll be doing in the gym.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, do the following:

If you fail to get all 6 reps in any (or all) of your sets for a lift, that's fine, just retry the same weight next time.

```
week 1:
workout 1: squat, bench, pull up
workout 2: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 3: squat, bench, pull up

week 2:
workout 1: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 2: squat, bench, pull up
workout 3: deadlift, press, bent row

workout 1.1:
  squat     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  bench     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  pull up   as many as you can in one set
workout 1.2:
  deadlift  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  press     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  bent row  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
workout 1.3:
  squat     2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  bench     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  pull up   same number as last time

workout 2.1:
  deadlift  2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  press     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
  bent row  2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time
workout 2.2:
  squat     2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  bench     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time

  deadlift  2x6 at 10 lbs more than last time
  press     2x6 at 5 lbs more than last time

```

and from then on just repeat the following program until you fail to add 5 lbs to the same lift 3 times in a row.

##### Before

It is smart to take a few underwear pics before you really get training. I suggest good lighting, stand up straight, and take one picture flexing and one picture relaxed.

It is also smart to record initial scale weight.

It is also smart to record initial body part measurements with some measuring tape:

Measurement Procedure: (from [here](http://www.weightrainer.net/maximum_potential.html))

- chest - measured relaxed (not flexed or expanded), arms at sides, tape under armpits
- biceps - flexed, at largest point
- forearms - fist clenched, hand out straight, measured at largest point
- neck - below Adam's apple at smallest point
- thighs - standing relaxed, midway between hip and knee
- calves - standing relaxed, at largest point

For all measurements tape should be snug but not compressing the flesh.

### Intermediate

By my reckoning, you are an intermediate lifter if you are currently failing to make progress on a reasonable beginner program. For young men, this can take around 6 months of consistent lifting. The rate of strength gains, weight gain, fat loss, etc will all drastically slow down here and it will probably feel like you are hitting plateaus. However, consistency and a little extra effort will see you still making noticable gains on a longer time horizon.


#### Intermediate Nutrition

Time to start calorie counting. For a few typical days, track protein grams per day consumed and total calories consumed using something like myfitnesspal or a spreadsheet and nutrition facts labels and google. Then, use a calorie calculator to figure out what your muscle gain calorie/day and protein/day requirements are. By now most people will be at or below 20% body fat so eating in a caloric surplus for a "bulking" phase is reasonable. If you are still above 20%, consider just eating maintenance calories for continued body recomposition. If your "typical" protein and calories are drastically off, take steps to getting them in line. It's probably not entirely necessary to autistically track every single meal and plan meals out weeks in advance at this point, but if you're not seeing progress, it's probably because you're not eating correct amounts of calories or protein.

Supplement wise, whey protein, creatine, and caffiene are probably worth your time at this point. Drink/take some caffeine before workouts, because it improves performance by reducing tiredness and blunting pain. Drink a whey protein shake shortly after workouts. Mix some creatine in for conveninece.

Alternating bulking/cutting cycles starts to be your going-forward plan. As a naturally skinny guy I find that 3 5-week cycles bulking, followed by 1 cycle cutting works well for me.

#### Intermediate Recovery

Things to start implementing:
- Ensure 7.5 to 9 hours sleep per night.
- Reduce stress in daily life.
- Take up daily prayer (or meditation if you're a godless heathen).
- Eat anti-inflammatory foods.
- Warm up adequatley before workouts, and strech thoroughly after workouts.

#### Intermediate Training

More complicated plans become reasonable at this level. There are a number of [variables](#training-variables-summary) you will need to start manipulating: exercise variation, rep variation, periodization, volume, frequency, rest periods, tempo, splits, etc.

Because of the wide range of variation in respone to various training stimuli that exists among the human population, things that work for one person are not guaranteed to work for someone else to the same degree. Thus, self experimentation and taking notes and listening to your body to customize your plan to yourself begins to take on increasing importance. If you or someone smart that you respect disagrees with a recommendation here, then by all means, compare the two approaches. But keep good notes, and stick to the things you try long enough to really see if they work. No program is going to get you the same results you did early on, so don't be disappointed with a month of work and only modest gains.

##### Programming

Programming is the bodybuilder's term for planning your workouts. The more advanced you are, the more complicated your plans will likely become. Programming can be rigid or flexible, vague or specific, depending on your circumstances, but in general a more clear plan is better than a less clear one because it reduces the time you waste in the gym, and can help you stay motivated and avoid overtraining.

Exercise variation becomes necessary in order to hit parts of the muscle which were not being hit enough by the beginner lifts, and to prevent overuse/joint injuries and strain.

Rep variation becomes necessary in order to see progressive overload, and because of joint recovery and other concerns. The "hypertrophy rep range" is 6-15 reps. However this range is not magic, it just makes hitting sufficient volume and intensity targets practical. Highly fatiguing exercises should be generally trained on the lower end of that rep range, and less fatiguing exercises should generally be on the higher end of that rep range.

Periodization becomes necessary at least to some degree, since it is highly likely that a lack of deload weeks will lead to overtraining, which causes lost strength and increased pain.

Increased volume becomes necessary because volume is a primary driver of hypertrophy, and we already got all the easy gains. From here on out, bigger muscles take a lot more work.

Frequency refers to how many times per week a muscle is worked. As your routine changes, and potentially becomes split, it is important to remember that there is some evidence showing benefit to training muscles 2-3 times per week as opposed to just 1 time per week.

Rest periods can be shortened to make sets more difficult, but it is not clear that this has benefit to hypertrophy, so I recommend 2 minutes between sets, or very short rest periods of 10-20 seconds for superset-like effects.

Tempo refers to the speed with which repetitions are performed.

It is time to start thinking of your workouts by muscle group. You should be trying to hit muscles with the maximum amount of volume that you can effectively recover from.

The muscles I organize my workouts around are:

- Big
  - chest
  - back
  - quads
  - hams
- little
  - shoulders
  - biceps
  - triceps
  - calfs
  - abs
  - traps
  - forearm

It is convenient for me to split my routine by (more or less) opposing muscle groups. Since I have week shoulder development, and since broad shoulders are the hallmark of a bro who even lifts, I put shoulders in every day. This looks like:

```
day 1: chest, quads, shoulders, biceps,  calfs, traps
day 2: back,  hams,  shoulders, triceps, abs,   forearms
```

The big muscles mostly are trained via big compound movements like bench press, bent row, squat, and deadlift. Notice that the "big" muscles come first in the workouts, followed by the little muscles that need to be trained with isolation exercises. This is a fatigue/performance management strategy.

### Advanced

Autoregulation.

#### Advanced Nutrition

Autoregulation because macro tracking is [psychologically costly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thHy0dfwN7g).

#### Advanced Recovery

#### Advanced Training

A large part of advanced training centers around fatigue management. The distinction between local (limited to one muscle group) fatigue and systemic (total body) fatigue becomes relevant. It may be that in order to progress on everything at once, your muscles require so much total work that the sum of the local fatigues will exceed your systemic fatigue. This is where the concept of fatigue rationing or management comes in, and you basically have to pick some body parts to just put on maintenance volume and other body parts to actually seek progression on, and then rotate through which muscles are being progressed.

##### Shoulders

the goal of the shoulder exercises is to target the side and rear delts since the front delts will be getting plenty of stimulation from bench pressing and other chest exercises. The overhead standing press, despite being super fun and cool and alpha chad is also overkill if you're bench pressing + doing isolation biceps+triceps work.

## Principles

Key principles to bodybuilding, in no particular order:

- volume(how much work you do) is a key driver of hypertrophy
- compound barbell lifts are an efficient use of time in the gym, but come with high fatigue costs, which need to be balanced in more advanced trainees
- Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter.
- consistency is king. Make a plan and stick to it.
- Nutrition, Sleep/stress, and Lifting are the 3 main parts of bodybuilding. Dont focus on juse one and neglect the others and then wonder why things arent going well
- progressive overload - workouts must consistently get harder in some metric or your body will have no reason to grow
  - you could do more sets
  - you could do more weight
  - you could do more reps per set
  - you could do more workouts per week
  - you could do less rest between sets
- most supplements are useless wastes of money, and the ones that arent only account for a VERY small percentage of your overall muscle growth (5% or less)

##### Energy balance

```
calories absorbed per day - calories burned per day = energy balance
```

If your energy balance is negative (you burn more than you absorb), you are in a **calorie deficit**. Calorie deficits cause your body to burn stored fat, which lowers your bodyfat percentage.

If your energy balance is positive (you absorb more than you burn), you are in a **calorie surplus**. Calorie surpluses cause your body to create new tissue, either muscle, fat, or both, to store energy for the future.

The percentage of calories that your body absorbs from the total amount you consume is variable, but usually pretty high. The # of calories that your body burns per day is more variable, and affected by how much you weigh, by how physically active you are, how long you have been in an energy deficit/surplus, how deep your energy deficit/surplus is, among other things.

> People often confuse the concept of "all calories being equal" and the laws of energy balance. Without question, there are differences in how various macronutrients -- and specific foods within the given macronutrients -- affect weight loss. But this doesn't negate the fact that energy balance still dictates weight gain/loss. Realize that there are two sides to the energy balance equation: Energy-in (what you consume) and energy-out (what you expend). ⁣
> 
> Foods have a thermic effect, whereby a certain percentage of calories are oxidized during digestion. Protein has a much higher thermic effect compared to carbs or fats, and thus on a calorie-for-calorie basis will cause less weight gain compared to the other macros. There are even differences in the thermic effect of the same macronutrients: for example, a significantly greater number of calories are expended in the digestion of olive oil (a monounsaturated fat) versus cream (a saturated fat). Moreover, protein can be directly used for building lean tissue, while other macronutrients cannot, thereby altering the composition of how weight is gained. ⁣
> 
> Fiber also plays a role in the process, as much of ingested fiber is not readily digestible and thus is excreted without being absorbed. Fiber also can bind to other nutrients and impede their digestion as well, further reducing energy intake. ⁣
> 
> Finally, and importantly, different foods have varying effects on satiety. Highly palatable foods (generally combinations of fat and simple sugars: think ice cream and donuts) make you want to eat more compared to whole, unprocessed foods, thus altering the energy balance equation in favor of weight gain.⁣
> 
> Bottom line: While a calorie isn't necessarily a calorie, energy balance nevertheless determines whether you gain or lose weight.⁣

-- brad schoenfeld

##### Macronutrients

The three macronutrients you need are protein, carbohydrates (carbs), and fat. These are measured in grams on the nutrition facts on food packaging. Protein has 4 calories per gram, Carbs have 4 calories per gram, and Fat has 9 calories per gram. Protein for a bodybuilder should be within the range of 0.8 to 1.2 g per day per pound of body weight. The remaining needed calories can be split between carbs and fat based on individual needs.

##### effective volume

First 10ish reps are easy, only the last few reps are stimulus to the muscle that will actually cause growth. So, here's where advanced techniques like dropsets and myoreps come in as ways to get more "effective volume" in less time spent in the gym. It's reasonable to say that a 2-drop set might be equivalent to 2 or 3 normal sets across, but in substantially less time, and using lighter weights, so presumably form is less likely to suffer, and fatigue is likely to be similar or even less than in straight sets. The differences here are pretty minimal, at least as far as current literature shows, so personal experimentation will have to lead the way to show if these techniques are useful to you.

##### soreness

Soreness is NOT necessary for hypertrophy. In fact, there is some evidence that being too sore is negative for hypertrophy, though light soreness is normal and fine. Soreness usually happens when you first work heavy a movement you have not worked in a long time. Im not sure what the biological mechanisms are but it seems to work very similarly to calluses. If you have no calluses on your feet and go running a lot all on one day, you are likely to get blisters, which are painful (like initial muscle soreness). But if you keep up the running regimen, you are going to develop calluses, and your feet will no longer hurt. Similarly, the first time you squat real heavy in a while, you are likely to become very sore, but if you keep squatting heavy on a regular basis that soreness should pretty much all go away.

##### reps in reserve

"RIR 3" means "reps in reserve 3".

which means you should keep going in reps until you feel that you could only get 3 more reps if your life depended on it

the [set]x[rep] targets next to exercises are just that: targets

the RIR determines how many reps you really do

so for a 3x14 goal, RIR 3 you just use a weight that you think you can do 14 reps and leave 3 in the tank

but if you get to rep 12 and you know you have at most one left in you, that's fine just stop, and lower the weight for the next set

it can be difficult to tell how many reps you truly have left in the tank if you dont have a lot of experience, so just do your best at that, and know that noobs tend to vastly overestimate how close they are to true muscular failure

like a study found that on average, people could get 6 reps more than they thought was possible with a given weight they thought was a "10 rep" weight

##### plateaus

from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VxbIQBs51A

first of all, many people think they are in a plateau when in actually they have just moved on to the intermediate stage of lifting and their rate of gains have slowed and their expectations are out of line with reality. If however from one month to the next you show no measurable improvment either in strength or muscle mass, then you can be considered to have plateaued.

To address true plateaus ask yoru self these question:
- Am I taking [deload](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/grow-like-a-new-lifter-again/) weeks?
- Am I getting enough calories? and enough protein?
- am I getting enough sleep?
- am I doing enough volume/do I know my volume landmarks?
- am I maxed out on systemic fatigue without being able to reach high enough local levels of fatigue?
- try an extended low volume phase to resensitize your body to high volume lifting
- have you focused on choosing exercises and using techinque that really targets the muscle that is stalled?

##### building a strength base

Sometimes you will hear people say to build a strength base before focusing on hypertrophy as a way to get bigger, but there's actually a case to be made for the opposite. First, in order for muscle to grow, all that's required is a sufficiently powerful stimulus. What constitutes such a stimulus is relative to your current level of adaptation. Thus if lifting 10lbs is hard enough for you, you will grow off of 10 lbs, where I might require 50lbs in the same movement. The weight itself is not the most important factor. What matters is its intensity for you, and of course, how much volume you do with it. However, one thing heavy weight do affect is joint integrity and fatigue. Lifting very heavy weights puts more total strain on your joints, which do not recover nearly as quickly as muscles. Lifting heavy weights also puts a larger strain on your recovery abilities relative to when you were weaker and were lifting a lighter weight. This is because while your muscles adapted for the heavier weight, the rest of your body did not adapt to the same degree for the ability to recover from a workout. Thus, getting stronger **before** getting bigger actually can be considered bad because it more quickly brings you to the level where joint strain and total body fatigue recovery become salient factors in your training. Basically, if you can grow from a lighter weight, in general, you should do that

##### rest times

Short rest or long rest between sets? that is the question. the answer is basically, rest until you feel recovered, up to 5 minutes. Using very short rest times is a potential time-saving technique but be warned:
