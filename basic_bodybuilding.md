# Basic Bodybuilding

Experiment with yourself! Human bodies have a wide range of variation in ability and responsiveness to training. Be your own scientist. If you or someone smart that you respect disagrees with a recommendation here, then by all means, compare the two approaches. But keep notes. The difference between someone serious about something and someone who is just dicking around is note taking and deep thought.

## Why bodybuilding?

Do I even need to answer this? Obviously you got interested in lifting because you want to look better. Don't bullshit me. More importantly, don't bullshit yourself. If you want to look better, sexier, buffer, jacked, ripped, or whatever, admit it consciously to yourself. Too much time is wasted in the gym by people who keep changing their training goals every week and then wonder why they don't make any impressive progress. If you're trying to get big one week and then trying to just lift strong the next week, and then doing cardio the week after that... Well you'll be way ahead of all the assholes sitting on the couch, but you're definitely not making optimal gains. If you really truly want to workout but not because you want to look better, fine. This isn't for you. But please don't pretend you want "general fitness" when what you really want is for Stacy to notice you and come over to your place after the party.

## Noob gainz

When you first start lifting you will get very quick strength gains, followed by very quick hypertrophic gains. ("Hypertrophy" is the science word for muscles getting bigger). Unfortunately, after you have been (seriously) training for anywhere between 1 month and 6 months, those gains taper off and all of a sudden you have to get smarter with your program or else you'll stall out and start to get frustrated. I certainly did, anyway.

So basically, when you're first starting out, *what* you doin the gym kinda doesn't matter. Just go. But as you progress, it continues to matter more and more, until you're eeking out tiny gainz on super complex mesocycles manipulating many variables. I will supply a full plan for beginners and so on, but You can get through the newbie stage with prett much anything. Starting Strength is what I did initially and it built me up to a 255lb squat for 5 reps (repititions) in 6 months. Stronglifts, 5/3/1, whatever. Just do something.

## Principles

Key principles to bodybuilding, in no particular order:

- volume(how much work you do) is a key driver of hypertrophy
- compound barbell lifts are an efficient use of time in the gym, but come with high fatigue costs, which need to be balanced in more advanced trainees
- Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter.
- consistency is king. Make a plan and stick to it.
- Nutrition, Sleep/stress, and Lifting are the 3 main parts of bodybuilding. Dont focus on juse one and neglect the others and then wonder why things arent going well
- progressive overload - workouts must consistently get harder in some metric or your body will have no reason to grow
  - you could do more sets
  - you could do more weight
  - you could do more reps per set
  - you could do more workouts per week
  - you could do less rest between sets
- most supplements are useless wastes of money, and the ones that arent only account for a VERY small percentage of your overall muscle growth (5% or less)
