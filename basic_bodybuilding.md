# Basic Bodybuilding

## in one sentence

Make a plan and be consistent in following it, because year in and year out dedication is what makes impressive physiques.

## in one minute

Because consistency is key, be sure to create a log of your workouts as you go.

Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter. Do your research about what is a [reasonable result](http://weightrainer.net/maximum_bodypred.html) for your body.

Nutrition, Recovery, and Training are the three pillars under which all aspects of bodybuilding fall, and each one is vitally important. Neglect one at your peril.

**Good nutrition** means eating the correct number of calories, from food sources which give you the correct grams of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. About 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is a good rule of thumb. Good nutrition requires planning out your meals and preparing them yourself, as well as restricting restaurant visits. Supplements beyond multivitiamins and creatine and whey protein and caffeine are generally a waste of money.

**Good recovery** means sleeping 7.5-9 hours per day, and keeping your stress levels low. Setting a regular bedtime and sticking to it is good. Naps are good. Prayer or meditation is good. Stretching, hot baths, music, journalling, or other legitimately relaxing activities are good.

**Good training** means lifting enough sets of heavy enough weights enough times per week to stimulate the muscles so that they grow. Compound barbell lifts are a good starting place, but may have a limiting fatigue to stimulus ratio as you get more advanced. Adding weight to the bar, or reps to the set, or sets to the session or in some way making the muscle stimulus increase from session to session, and week to week is fundamental to building muscle. Varying exercise selection is important in order to activate the full range of muscle fibers. Deloading is often necessary for intermediate and advanceed trainees.

### What bodybuilding is

Bodybuilding is manipulating the muscle and fat portions of your body compisition in order to create and maintain an aesthetic physique. For most men this boils down to keeping your [Body Fat Percentage](#body-fat-estimator) (BF%) between 6-15% and raising your [Fat Free Mass Index](#ffmi-calc) (FFMI) to your genetic ceiling (between 24 and 27).

In other words, **build muscle** and **lose fat**.

Bodybuilding, like many human endeavors, has levels of complexity that increase as you progress. However unlike many endeavors, people are often tempted to focus on the advanced issues first, and ignore the basics. Each of the three pillars of Nutrition, Recovery, and Training are filled with minutia that are highly unlikely to affect a beginner. While it is theoretically possible for an ultra-obessed novice to immediately start putting everything into practice, in reality that is rarely a good idea, since being overwhelmed lowers the odds that you will consistently stick to it. And the most important part of bodybuilding is **adherence**.

Can you stick to your training? Can you be rock solid and never miss a workout, always hit your macros, never stay up too late, etc? So if some advanced technique with minor benefit is going to impact your ability to ADHERE TO THE PLAN, do not bother with it. It will be counterproductive. 

So while this document will try to go into all the details, please do not miss the forest for the trees. Advanced lifters can worry about complicated techniques and nutrient timing. Novices just need to actually lift.

### Why bodybuilding?

Do I even need to answer this? Obviously you got interested in lifting because you want to look better. Don't bullshit me. More importantly, don't bullshit yourself. If you want to look better, sexier, buffer, jacked, ripped, or whatever, admit it consciously to yourself. Too much time is wasted in the gym by people who keep changing their training goals every week and then wonder why they don't make any impressive progress. If you're trying to get big one week and then trying to just lift strong the next week, and then doing cardio the week after that... Well you'll be way ahead of all the assholes sitting on the couch, but you're definitely not making optimal gains. If you really truly want to workout but not because you want to look better, fine. This isn't for you. But please don't pretend you want "general fitness" when what you really want is for Stacy to notice you and come over to your place after the party.

### Beginner

When you first start lifting you will get very quick strength gains, followed by very quick hypertrophic gains. ("Hypertrophy" is the science word for muscles getting bigger). Unfortunately, after you have been (seriously) training for anywhere between 1 month and 6 months, those gains taper off and all of a sudden you have to get smarter with your program or else you'll stall out and start to get frustrated. I certainly did, anyway.

So basically, when you're first starting out, *what* you do in the gym kinda doesn't matter. Just go. But as you progress, it continues to matter more and more, until you're eeking out tiny gainz on super complex mesocycles manipulating many variables. I will supply a full plan for beginners and so on, but you can get through the newbie stage with pretty much anything. Starting Strength is what I did initially and it built me up to a 255lb squat for 5 reps in 6 months. Stronglifts, 5/3/1, whatever. Just do something.

#### Beginner Nutrition

If you are higher than 20% bf%, you'll want to start off in a [calorie deficit](#energy-balance). In lieu of complicated calorie tracking you can probably achieve this by doing any or all of the following:

- Restrict eating only to mealtimes. No snacks between meals.
- Remove soda from your diet.
- Remove or reduce alcohol intake.
- Count how many times you eat food from a restaurant in a normal week, and limit that number to a few less than normal.
- Restricting meals to only what can fit on one plate. No seconds.
- Skipping breakfast.
- Drinking water when you are hungry for a snack instead of eating the snack.
- Eating more raw vegetables. (High satiety to calorie ratio)

If you are lower than 20% bf%, you'll want to start off in a [calorie surplus](#energy-balance). In lieu of complicated calorie tracking you can probably achieve this by doing any or all of the following:

- Ensure you eat at least 3 meals per day.
- Eat until it feels like you are forcing it at each meal.
- Drink whole milk. (Low satiety to calorie ratio)
- Add in protein shakes.

#### Beginner Recovery

Set a bed time and stick to it at least 6 out of 7 nights per week. Proper sleep is integral to muscle growth. Sleep is when a lot of the muscle damage from training is repaired, and new tissue is built.

#### Beginner Training

There are several steps that should be completed before you lift any weights:

1. [get a place to workout (home or gym)](#where-to-workout)
2. schedule time to workout (initially 3 days per week)
3. write out training [plan](#training-planning) + [log](#training-logging)
4. Watch youtube [videos](#youtube-exercise-technique) on technique for the exercises in your plan
5. take ["before" picture](#before) and measurements (weight, arm, leg, neck, etc)
6. use peaking [calculator](http://weightrainer.net/maximum_bodypred.html) to estimate where you could legitimately end up

##### Where to workout

Home is better than gym if you have space and can afford the upfront cost. Some people live in cramped quarters or are bad with money and live paycheck to paycheck. For these people the only real option is gym.

If doing gym, pick whatever gym is closest, cheapest and has a squat rack/bench presses. Smith-machines are NOT squat racks.

If doing home, buy a:
- [squat stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01855EGXI) ($70)
- inclineable bench ($80 - $150)
- olympic barbell + plate set ($225 at academy)
- 2 bumper 45-lb plates ($120)
- 2 Loadable 20" Olympic Dumbbells (~$60)

total cost: $625 max. Cheaper if you can get em used, which is often possible. a $40 gym membership means this is a cheaper route in less than 16 months, not to mention more convenient. Worth it.

##### Training logging

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
$ ./lift.rb log 'bench' 150x8 150x8 150x7 -rir 8
```

And your activity will be recorded, and your bench strength will be updated for future reference giving weight/rep-range combos.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, just use a spreadsheet.

Be sure to log each workout, as well as regular weight and body measurements. Without good logging, it will be very difficult to gauge progress.

##### Training planning

I suggest using the tool in this repo.

```
./lift.rb schedule program --beginner
```

And it will schedule your first 3 months of lifting. Then you can just `./lift.rb show week` each week to see what you'll be doing in the gym.

But if you are afraid of terminal or something, do the following:

If you fail to get all 6 reps in any (or all) of your sets for a lift, that's fine, just retry the same weight next time.

```
week 1:
workout 1: squat, bench, pull up
workout 2: deadlift, press, bent row
workout 3: squat, bench, pull up

  bench     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  pull up   as many as you can in one set

  deadlift  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  press     work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy
  bent row  work up to until a set of 6 feels pretty heavy

##### Before

It is smart to take a few underwear pics before you really get training. I suggest good lighting, stand up straight, and take one picture flexing and one picture relaxed.

It is also smart to record initial scale weight.

It is also smart to record initial body part measurements with some measuring tape:

Measurement Procedure: (from [here](http://www.weightrainer.net/maximum_potential.html))

- chest - measured relaxed (not flexed or expanded), arms at sides, tape under armpits
- biceps - flexed, at largest point
- forearms - fist clenched, hand out straight, measured at largest point
- neck - below Adam's apple at smallest point
- thighs - standing relaxed, midway between hip and knee
- calves - standing relaxed, at largest point

For all measurements tape should be snug but not compressing the flesh.

### Intermediate

By my reckoning, you are an intermediate lifter if you are currently failing to make progress on a reasonable beginner program. For young men, this can take around 6 months of consistent lifting. The rate of strength gains, weight gain, fat loss, etc will all drastically slow down here and it will probably feel like you are hitting plateaus. However, consistency and a little extra effort will see you still making noticable gains on a longer time horizon.

#### Intermediate Nutrition

Time to start calorie counting.

#### Intermediate Recovery

Ensure 7.5 to 9 hours sleep per night. Reduce stress in daily life. Take up daily prayer (or meditation if you're a godless heathen).

#### Intermediate Training

Exercise variation, rep variation, periodization, increased volume, deload weeks.

### Advanced

#### Advanced Nutrition

#### Advanced Recovery

#### Advanced Training

---

Experiment with yourself! Human bodies have a wide range of variation in ability and responsiveness to training. Be your own scientist. If you or someone smart that you respect disagrees with a recommendation here, then by all means, compare the two approaches. But keep notes. The difference between someone serious about something and someone who is just dicking around is note taking and deep thought.


## Principles

Key principles to bodybuilding, in no particular order:

- volume(how much work you do) is a key driver of hypertrophy
- compound barbell lifts are an efficient use of time in the gym, but come with high fatigue costs, which need to be balanced in more advanced trainees
- Expectations should match reality. Do not compare yourself to steriod using 10+ year lifters if you are a natural 2nd year lifter.
- consistency is king. Make a plan and stick to it.
- Nutrition, Sleep/stress, and Lifting are the 3 main parts of bodybuilding. Dont focus on juse one and neglect the others and then wonder why things arent going well
- progressive overload - workouts must consistently get harder in some metric or your body will have no reason to grow
  - you could do more sets
  - you could do more weight
  - you could do more reps per set
  - you could do more workouts per week
  - you could do less rest between sets
- most supplements are useless wastes of money, and the ones that arent only account for a VERY small percentage of your overall muscle growth (5% or less)

## Step by Step Overview

if you are a raw total beginner


if you have already gotten easy newbie gains

1. strict macro-counting meal plan
2. supplements
3. follow 3 cycles bulking, 1 cycle cutting meso-cycles lifting plan generator, starting at 6-10 sets and working your way up based on your own body feedback
4. repeat step 3 for 3 years

if you are an advanced lifter

1. great go figure your own shit out

# notes to self

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thHy0dfwN7g @ 14:20 very good summary of Training aspect of bodybuilding

##### ffmi-calc

Lean = Weight in kg x (1.0 - (Body fat %/ 100.0))

FFMI = (Lean / 2.2) / ((Height in ft x 12.0 + in) x 0.0254)2 x 2.20462

##### body-fat-estimator

Estimate your body fat percentage by comparing to this chart

![Body Fat Percentage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190717145633if_/http://approvemymacros.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BODY-FAT-PERCENT-CHART.jpg "body fat % estimator")

##### Energy balance

```
calories absorbed per day - calories burned per day = energy balance
```

If your energy balance is negative (you burn more than you absorb), you are in a **calorie deficit**. Calorie deficits cause your body to burn stored fat, which lowers your bodyfat percentage.

If your energy balance is positive (you absorb more than you burn), you are in a **calorie surplus**. Calorie surpluses cause your body to create new tissue, either muscle, fat, or both, to store energy for the future.

The percentage of calories that your body absorbs from the total amount you consume is variable, but usually pretty high. The # of calories that your body burns per day is more variable, and affected by how much you weigh, by how physically active you are, how long you have been in an energy deficit/surplus, how deep your energy deficit/surplus is, among other things.

##### Macronutrients

The three macronutrients you need are protein, carbohydrates (carbs), and fat. These are measured in grams on the nutrition facts on food packaging. Protein has 4 calories per gram, Carbs have 4 calories per gram, and Fat has 9 calories per gram. Protein for a bodybuilder should be within the range of 0.8 to 1.2 g per day per pound of body weight. The remaining needed calories can be split between carbs and fat based on individual needs.
