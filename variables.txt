muscles
Big:
  - chest
  - back

  - quads
  - hams
little:
  - shoulders

  - biceps
  - triceps

  - calfs
  - abs

  - traps
  - forearm

Basic plan:
5 week cycle (4 on/1 deload)
split similar muscles to different days (shoulders/chest quads/hams triceps/biceps)
start at bottom of productive volume range (MEV) and cycle up to top (MRV)
start at top of productive rep range and cycle down to bottom of productive rep range (15 down to 6)
Move RIR from 3 to 1
1st 2 week 3 days /week, 2nd 2 weeks 4 days/week
keep rest between sets constant (2 minutes)
keep tempo constant (fast concentric 3sec eccentric, no holds)
always just do 2 sets for "little" muscles, dont try to hit set targets.
little muscles start at 18 reps and work down to 9
try BFR on biceps on first week

Exercises:
  Chest       bench, db flyes
  Back        low bar bent row, chin up
  Quads       front squat, squat, barbell hack squat
  Hams        goodmorning, stiff-leg deadlift
  ...
  Shoulder    upright row, db lat raise, db bent reverse fly (?behind neck press?)
  Biceps      bar standing curl, db standing curl
  Triceps     db overhead extension, nosebreaker
  Calfs       calfs
  Abs         crunch, reverse crunch
  Traps       bar shrugs
  Forearms    wrist curl

BFR notes (https://www.t-nation.com/training/blood-flow-restriction-training)

The weights used during BFR should be light. As a rule, keep the loads at ~20-30% of 1RM for a given exercise. Combined with occlusion, you should get about ~20-25 reps on the first set.

Thereafter, perform a few additional sets of the chosen exercise while keeping rest periods at about 30 seconds or so. The short rest interval helps to heighten metabolic stress and pooling of blood in the working muscle. It also necessarily reduces the number of reps you're able to perform on successive sets.

By the final set, assuming you maintain the same load, you'll probably only get around 8-10 reps. That's okay. As long as you follow the protocol as described, you'll achieve optimal anabolic benefits.

----------
Question regarding intensity, fatigue, stimulus, volume and an impractical training program. (mini sessions)
----------
Of course the best way to answer this question would just be to try it and take notes, but Im still interested in people's thoughts.

And obviously, this is **incredibly** impractical for anyone who has a life, but....

**What kind of gainz do you think would result from a plan that sought to reduce fatigue and raise total stimulus/volume by splitting workouts up into many mini-sessions throughout the day?**

The principles behind this idea:

* volume is a primary driver of hypertrophy
* pushing sets to muscular failure generally seems to get you a lot more fatigue than the stimulus is worth
* shortening rest times seems to get you a lot of fatigue that just reduces your ability to lift heavy and get good stimulus
* keeping fatigue as low as possible facilities more volume
* big muscles recover more slowly than small muscles

The idea is that because of the principles above, we should seek to make individual sessions very easy (low fatigue) overall, and just compensate by doing a ton of sessions to get in the volume.

An example program applying this idea would looks something like:

**mini session**

* warm up sets
* 1 hard (1-3 reps-in-reserve) set of the "big" muscle group you're working that day
* 2 hard sets for one of the "small" muscle groups you're working that day

**day**

6 mini sessions spaced evenly throughout the day. Ex:

day 1 - Big: chest. Small: biceps, abs, traps

    8am - warmup, bench x1, curls x2
    11am - warmup, dumbell flyes x1,  crunch x2
    2pm - warmup, bench x1, shrugs x2
    5pm - warmup, dumbell flyes x1,  curls x2
    8pm - warmup, bench x1, crunch x2
    11pm - warmup, dumbell flyes x1, shrugs x2

**week**

train 6 days per week, picking one "big" muscle and 3 little muscles per day. ex:

    day 1
      chest
      biceps, abs, traps
    day 2
      quads
      shoulders, triceps, calfs
    day 3
      back
      shoulders, biceps, abs
    day 4
      hams
      shoulders, triceps, calfs
    day 5
      chest
      biceps, abs, traps
    day 6
      back
      shoulders, triceps, calfs
    day 7
      rest
