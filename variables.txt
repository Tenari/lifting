muscles
Big:
  - chest
  - back

  - quads
  - hams
little:
  - shoulders

  - biceps
  - triceps

  - calfs
  - abs

  - traps
  - forearm

Basic plan:
5 week cycle (4 on/1 deload)
split similar muscles to different days (shoulders/chest quads/hams triceps/biceps)
start at bottom of productive volume range (MEV) and cycle up to top (MRV)
start at top of productive rep range and cycle down to bottom of productive rep range (15 down to 6)
Move RIR from 3 to 1
1st 2 week 3 days /week, 2nd 2 weeks 4 days/week
keep rest between sets constant (2 minutes)
keep tempo constant (fast concentric 3sec eccentric, no holds)
always just do 2 sets for "little" muscles, dont try to hit set targets.
little muscles start at 18 reps and work down to 9
try BFR on biceps on first week

Exercises:
  Chest       bench, db flyes
  Back        low bar bent row, chin up
  Quads       front squat, squat, barbell hack squat
  Hams        goodmorning, stiff-leg deadlift
  ...
  Shoulder    upright row, db lat raise, db bent reverse fly (?behind neck press?)
  Biceps      bar standing curl, db standing curl
  Triceps     db overhead extension, nosebreaker
  Calfs       calfs
  Abs         crunch, reverse crunch
  Traps       bar shrugs
  Forearms    wrist curl

BFR notes (https://www.t-nation.com/training/blood-flow-restriction-training)

The weights used during BFR should be light. As a rule, keep the loads at ~20-30% of 1RM for a given exercise. Combined with occlusion, you should get about ~20-25 reps on the first set.

Thereafter, perform a few additional sets of the chosen exercise while keeping rest periods at about 30 seconds or so. The short rest interval helps to heighten metabolic stress and pooling of blood in the working muscle. It also necessarily reduces the number of reps you're able to perform on successive sets.

By the final set, assuming you maintain the same load, you'll probably only get around 8-10 reps. That's okay. As long as you follow the protocol as described, you'll achieve optimal anabolic benefits.
